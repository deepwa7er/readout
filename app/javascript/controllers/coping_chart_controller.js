// The live throughput chart, drawn straight onto a canvas at 30fps.
//
// WHY NOT A CHART LIBRARY:
//
// Chart.js rebuilds scales, ticks and layout on every update(). That is fine
// once a second; at 30fps over a series growing to a couple of thousand points
// it falls behind and stutters. Drawing one polyline is about a hundred lines of
// canvas code and holds 30fps without effort, so the library was costing 186KB
// to do the job slower.
//
// WHY THERE IS A PLAYHEAD:
//
// Data arrives in batches — one fetch every few hundred milliseconds brings a
// dozen new points at once. Drawing them the moment they land makes the line
// leap forward and then sit still until the next batch, which reads as stuttering
// however smooth the curve through the points is. So the chart keeps a playhead
// that advances with wall-clock time and reveals points as it passes them,
// deliberately trailing the newest data by a small buffer. It is the same idea as
// a video player holding a fraction of a second in hand: the line then extends
// continuously at frame rate, and a late fetch costs smoothness rather than
// causing a visible jump.
//
// WHAT MAKES IT SMOOTH RATHER THAN JUST FAST:
//
// The data arrives already at 33ms resolution — each point counts requests over
// the preceding FULL SECOND, stepped forward 33ms at a time (see the runner's
// rolling.go). So there is real sub-second detail to animate and every point
// still means something. Fetching happens a few times a second; drawing happens
// every frame, so motion stays continuous between fetches.
//
// Both axes are fixed for the whole run — x to the known 50-second duration, y
// to the requested rate plus headroom — so the frame never resizes and the line
// simply grows into it.
