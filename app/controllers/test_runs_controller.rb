  # rate together (5 posts/sec × 100 people = 500 deliveries/sec). A request
  # rate alone names a number that cannot be interpreted.
  #
  # enterprise: many rooms with a power-law distribution — "what does a whole
  # company cost on one box". The lever is VUS (concurrent employees), spread
  # across Pareto-distributed rooms (median 4-6, p95 150-250) with HOT_ROOM_SHARE
  # held low so the 10k room behaves like a rarely-written announcement channel.
