# Readout

A Rails dashboard for [campfire-stress](../campfire-stress) load-test results.

It reads the `results/<timestamp>/` directories the harness writes, and answers
the question a raw k6 summary cannot: **at what point did it stop keeping up,
and what ran out?**

## Why it exists

k6's end-of-run summary aggregates every ramp step into one set of percentiles.
A p95 spanning 25 and 800 virtual users describes neither, and the knee — the
level where the application stops keeping up — is averaged away entirely.

Readout re-buckets every sample by the VU count in effect when it was recorded,
then joins that against the server-side CPU trace, so a latency knee can be
attributed rather than guessed at.

## Running it

```sh
bin/readout
```

That prepares the database, imports any results, and serves on
<http://localhost:3000>. Options:

| | |
|---|---|
| `--no-import` | serve without importing (use during a load run) |
| `--import-only` | import and exit, without a server |
| `-p 3123` | serve on another port |
| `--open` | open a browser once the port answers |

**It refuses to import while `k6` is running.** Parsing a 700k-line CSV is
several seconds of hard CPU, and this machine is the load generator — stealing
cores mid-run shows up as latency that would be wrongly blamed on the
application under test.

The plain Rails commands work too, since `mise.toml` pins Ruby 3.4.8 for this
directory:

```sh
bin/rails db:prepare && bin/rails server
bin/rails runner 'Analysis::Importer.import_all(Rails.configuration.x.campfire_stress.results_root)'
```

The results directory defaults to `~/code/campfire-stress/results` and is
overridable with `CAMPFIRE_STRESS_RESULTS`. You can also press **Rescan
results** on the index.

Re-importing a directory replaces its derived rows in place, so it is the normal
way to refresh a run after changing the analyzer.

## Launching tests from the UI

There is **one** Readout, at <https://readout.intern.deepwa7er.net>, and it can
do everything: browse results, configure and launch a load test, watch k6's
output live, and receive the results when the run finishes.

The work happens on the dev box. The dashboard runs on the VPS and drives a
**runner** service on the Mac, which is where k6 lives and where the CPU to
generate load is.

```
browser ──► readout (VPS) ──tailnet──► runner (Mac) ──► k6 ──► Campfire (fedora-1)
                  ▲                                                │
                  └────────── bin/publish ships results ◄───────────┘
```

The form has **two levers**, both pointing the same way — turn either up and the
server does more work:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Load** | concurrent users (requests/sec for `arrival`) |
| **Minutes** | how long to hold it |

They map to whichever variable is the natural intensity dial for the chosen
scenario, so you never have to remember which is which:

| scenario | Load becomes | Minutes becomes |
|---|---|---|
| `browsing` | `VUS` | `HOLD` |
| `ramp` | `RAMP_STEPS` — quarter, half, full | `STEP_HOLD` |
| `arrival` | `ARRIVAL_RATE` | `ARRIVAL_DURATION` |
| `smoke` | — | — |

`USER_POOL` is sized to the load automatically rather than exposed: with fewer
identities than VUs they start sharing sessions, which distorts presence and
unread bookkeeping. That is a property of an honest run, not a preference.

The harness's other ~20 levers — room size, action mix, think time, subscriber
count — are hidden here, not removed. They remain available through the runner
API and the CLI.

Start it and the run page shows two things: a **Keeping up?** chart of p95
response time while the run is in flight, with current server CPU beside it, and
the streaming harness output below.

Latency is the honest answer to "is the server handling this" — flat means it is
keeping up, rising means it is not. CPU sits next to it as a number rather than a
second line, because it answers a different question (*why*): latency climbing
while CPU stays low is not a compute limit.

The live chart is **Chart.js on a canvas**, and it sits deliberately *outside* the
polled Turbo Frame. The frame replaces its contents every two seconds; a chart
rebuilt that often flickers and, with `height: auto`, can collapse to nothing in
WebKit. The canvas is created once and only its data changes.

The static charts on an imported run stay server-rendered SVG — see
`app/helpers/chart_helper.rb` for why the two cases differ.

Progress covers the **whole run**, accumulated incrementally by the runner
(reading only bytes appended since the last poll), so watching a test cannot slow
down the machine generating it.
When it finishes the runner publishes automatically — imports the results and
rsyncs the database up — so the run appears on the dashboard with no further
action. **Publish results** on the run page is the retry if that fails.

Setup is one command on the Mac:

```sh
cd ~/code/campfire-stress && deploy/install-runner-agent.sh
```

That installs a launchd agent (`com.deepwa7er.readout-runner`) that starts at
login and restarts on crash.

### What this exposes

The runner binds the Mac's **tailnet IPv4**, not loopback — that is what lets the
VPS drive it, and it is the price of having one app instead of two.

So a service that starts processes on the laptop is reachable from every device
on the tailnet. It is much narrower than an arbitrary command endpoint (fixed
command, allowlisted scenarios, bounded levers, shared token — see
`campfire-stress/runner/README.md`), but it is the same category of exposure that
`breakwater.toml` flags for the `harness` route. Worth revisiting if the tailnet
ever gains a device trusted less than this laptop.

Two consequences of the split worth knowing:

- **The Mac must be awake.** If it is asleep or off the tailnet, the address does
  not resolve, `RUNNER_URL` comes up empty, and the launch button simply
  disappears. Reading results keeps working — that degradation is deliberate.
- **One run at a time.** A second launch is refused rather than queued, because
  two concurrent load tests would each measure the other.

## Deployment

Live at **<https://readout.intern.deepwa7er.net>** (tailnet only, behind
breakwater's wildcard cert).

```sh
bin/publish            # import results here, ship the database up, restart
tugboat deploy --working-tree   # ship a new build of the app itself
```

Those are two different things, and the split is the whole design:

| | changes | how |
|---|---|---|
| the **app** | code | `tugboat deploy` — builds an amd64 image, ships the tar, restarts the unit |
| the **data** | new load-test runs | `bin/publish` — imports here, rsyncs `production.sqlite3` |

`bin/publish` exists because the raw results only live on the dev box. The
deployed instance detects that it has no results directory and presents itself as
a **published snapshot**: no path, no rescan button. It is not a live view of a
running test.

### How it runs on the VPS

readout is the fleet's first containerised deployable. The VPS has Ruby 3.2.3 and
this app needs 3.4.8, so a native install would mean maintaining a second Ruby on
the host; the image carries its own instead.

It still deploys like everything else. tugboat ships one artifact (the image tar)
and restarts one systemd unit, whose `ExecStartPre` loads the tar — so a failed
health check rolls back to the previous image exactly as it would to a previous
binary. `deploy/provision.sh` sets up the unit, and is a one-time/on-change step.

The container publishes to loopback `:8101`; breakwater fronts it. Its route in
`breakwater.toml` is hand-written, because readout's repo lives outside the fleet
monorepo and `tugboat fleet gen` cannot read this manifest (same arrangement as
lagoon).

Puma runs a single worker and the container is capped at 400MB — the VPS has 2GB
total shared with the rest of the fleet. It settles around 130MB.

> `config/master.key` is gitignored and must exist at `/opt/readout/master.key`
> on the host, owned by uid 1000 so the container's `rails` user can read it.
> Without it the app cannot boot.

## Where this runs, and where it must not

It runs in two places on purpose:

- **This Mac**, via `bin/readout` — where the results are, for working through a
  run right after it finishes.
- **The VPS**, via `tugboat deploy` — for reading results from a phone, or when
  the laptop is asleep.

**Never on `fedora-1`.** That box is the system under test, and a web server
sitting alongside Campfire becomes part of what you are measuring. The VPS is a
different machine entirely, so hosting there costs the measurements nothing —
only the data has to travel.

That the data travels well is not an accident: only the import path touches the
filesystem, so the SQLite file is a complete deliverable on its own.

## What it will and will not conclude

A run that degrades while the server still has CPU headroom is **not** reported
as an application limit. `fedora-1` is on Wi-Fi and a Campfire room page is
~400KB, so it is entirely possible to saturate the wireless link before the app
breaks a sweat — which looks identical to an application limit if you only read
client-side latency.

So the verdict distinguishes three cases:

| Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|
| No level degraded | limit is above the load tested |
| Knee + CPU ≥ 85% of the host | compute is a fair explanation |
| Knee + CPU headroom | *not* compute — suspect the link or SQLite write contention |

That threshold is deliberately high (`Analysis::CPU_SATURATION_FRACTION`). A run
peaking at 70% of the box has real headroom, and calling that "CPU bound" would
pin the knee on the application when the ceiling was somewhere else.

Server-side figures are always bounded to the run's own time window. A
`server.csv` is not guaranteed to describe only its own run: until the harness's
sampler process handling was fixed, every `bin/run.sh` invocation leaked a remote
sampling loop that kept appending to that run's file — recording load generated
by *later* runs. Windowing makes the numbers correct regardless.

## Layout

```
app/models/analysis.rb                    shared constants and thresholds
app/models/analysis/metrics_file.rb       streams k6 metrics.csv (files reach ~700k lines)
app/models/analysis/level_breakdown.rb    segments the VU timeline; the core judgement
app/models/analysis/percentile.rb         linear-interpolated percentile, matching k6's
app/models/analysis/server_trace.rb       parses the server-side CPU/WAL sampler output
app/models/analysis/run_config.rb         reads run-config.txt
app/models/analysis/importer.rb           the only part that knows about ActiveRecord
app/helpers/chart_helper.rb               inline SVG charts, server-rendered
app/helpers/runs_helper.rb                figure formatting and the run verdict
app/models/harness/client.rb              talks to the local runner service
app/controllers/test_runs_controller.rb   configure, launch, watch, import
```

Parsing is plain Ruby over `IO`, deliberately separate from the models: the
largest `metrics.csv` seen so far is 695k lines, `CSV.parse` is avoided entirely,
and only the first three columns are read.

## Notes on the implementation

**Levels come from the `vus` gauge, not the configured schedule**, so the output
reflects what actually ran.

**Segments must be contiguous.** A ramp visits the same level twice, once
climbing and once on the way down. Treating those as one window merges two
unrelated periods and counts the gap between them as elapsed time, which
silently deflates throughput. There is a test for this.

**A settling quarter is trimmed** from the front of each level: a level just
stepped into is still filling connection pools and warming caches.

**Charts are server-rendered SVG from Ruby**, not a JavaScript charting library.
The data is already on the server and the charts are static; a chart library
would mean a build step and a dependency for what amounts to a polyline. They
take their colors from CSS custom properties, so light and dark mode follow for
free.

## Styling

The design rules, tokens, and components come from the **notes** app
(`~/code/fleet/notes/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`) and are carried
over verbatim at the top of `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`.

Two things that app did not need are marked in the stylesheet as extensions,
with the rule each derives from:

- **Tables** — from rules 1 and 5: no row rules or zebra striping (gaps carry
  the grouping), every column header is instrumentation, all figures use tabular
  numerals.
- **A wider container** — the notes app uses a 40rem prose measure; a ten-column
  results table cannot honestly fit it, so the shell is 64rem and prose sections
  keep the original measure via `.measure`.

The accent stays reserved for interactive elements (rule 4), which is why chart
lines are drawn in ink rather than blue, and why a breached figure is colored
with `--danger` rather than the accent.

## Tests

```sh
bin/rails test
```

The analyzer is covered against hand-built timelines (segmentation, settling,
throughput) and end to end against a generated results directory, so the parsing
path is exercised without depending on an 80MB artifact.
